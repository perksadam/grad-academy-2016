# Creating A Node Web Server


## Now we are going to have our server return an html file from the file system
---
 Add an HMTL file to the directory called "sample.html"
 
 **paste the following html into sample.html**
 
>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sample HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    This is a sample HTML page
</body>
</html>
```
